# Quiet

Quiet people, places, and moments have meaningful things to say, but such is the way of the world that the louder and bolder tend to get more attention. I am decidedly a quiet person, preferring to be sure of what I say rather than speak too soon. Thus, I have found a kinship with the natural world, where quiet places and moments are much more common than in humanity - not just audibly, but in terms of being uninterested in attention-grabbing. I admire that the natural world has no ego to feed.

This collection showcases images with gentle features, such as soft light, pastel colors, smooth shapes, and simple subjects, in order to serve as a platform for the quiet ones whose important messages are not always heard.
